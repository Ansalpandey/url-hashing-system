# Assumptions for URL Hashing and Click Tracking System

This document outlines the assumptions made during the development of the URL Hashing and Click Tracking System. These assumptions are critical to understanding the design choices, features, and limitations of the system.

## 1. User Requirements

1. **Target Users**: The primary users of this system are the marketing team at NewsBytes, who require a solution to manage long URLs with UTM tracking effectively. It is assumed that these users have basic technical knowledge to interact with the system via API requests or a user interface.

2. **Ease of Use**: The system should be straightforward enough for non-technical users to generate hashed URLs without needing extensive technical knowledge.

## 2. System Functionality

3. **URL Integrity**: It is assumed that the integrity of the original URLs must be preserved during the hashing process. The system will maintain the full URL structure, including any query parameters.

4. **Usage Limits**: The system is designed with the assumption that URLs can be configured to have usage limits (single-use or limited-use). Users will expect functionality that enforces these limits strictly.

5. **Click Tracking**: It is assumed that tracking the number of clicks on each URL is essential for the users to analyze the performance of their campaigns.

6. **Privacy Concerns**: Users assume that the system will ensure privacy by generating hashed URLs that do not expose the original URL to anyone who accesses the hashed link.

## 3. Technical Assumptions

7. **Technology Stack**: The development is based on Node.js and Express for the backend, with MongoDB as the database. It is assumed that these technologies are suitable for the scalability and performance requirements of the system.

8. **Availability of Dependencies**: The project relies on specific libraries (like `nanoid` for URL hashing and `dotenv` for environment variable management). It is assumed that these libraries will be maintained and compatible with the latest versions of Node.js.

9. **MongoDB Connection**: It is assumed that the MongoDB instance will be available and accessible from the application server, whether it's a local or cloud setup.

## 4. Performance Expectations

10. **Response Time**: The system is assumed to provide quick response times for generating hashed URLs and tracking clicks. Users expect to see results within a few seconds.

11. **Scalability**: It is assumed that the system can handle a reasonable number of simultaneous requests, with provisions for scaling up if demand increases.

## 5. Deployment Assumptions

12. **Deployment Environment**: The application is assumed to be deployed in a stable environment (like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS) with proper configurations for MongoDB and environmental variables.

13. **Server Maintenance**: It is assumed that there will be minimal downtime and that maintenance tasks will be scheduled during off-peak hours to avoid impacting users.

## 6. Limitations and Constraints

14. **Limited Use Case**: The system is primarily designed for the marketing team at NewsBytes. It is assumed that it may not cater to broader use cases outside this specific requirement without further modifications.

15. **Internet Connectivity**: The application assumes that users have reliable internet access to interact with the API endpoints and access the generated URLs.

16. **Data Retention**: It is assumed that the data (click counts, original URLs, hashed URLs) will be retained for a specific period, and there will be a strategy in place for data purging to avoid database bloat.

## Conclusion

These assumptions serve as a foundational understanding of the URL Hashing and Click Tracking System's design and implementation. Any changes to these assumptions during the project lifecycle may require reevaluation of the system's functionality and capabilities.
